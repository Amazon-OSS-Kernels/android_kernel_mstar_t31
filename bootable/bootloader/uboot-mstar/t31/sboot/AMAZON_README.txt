BUILDING UBoot
-------------------

1.  Obtain a copy of gcc arm_eabi-2011.03 compiler or a substitute cross-compiler.
        Recommended download link: https://github.com/AdiPat/Android_Toolchains/tree/master/arm-2011.03
        Add its bin path to environment variable PATH

	export PATH="<path/to/arm-eabi-2011.03/bin>:$PATH"

2.  Update mk_config and paste in the path to the root of the copy of the compiler in the
    CROSS_COMPILER_PATH variable.

3.  Ensure that sh is symlinked to bash in the /bin directory.

    a. If it is not symlinked, run:

       ln -s /bin/bash /bin/sh

    b. If it is already symlinked to something other than bash, run:

       sudo ln -sf /bin/bash /bin/sh

3.  Execute the make script for <Public Name> by running:

    ./mk mtk_t31

4.  Output can be found in out/unsigned/sboot.bin.unsigned and out/unsigned/u-boot.bin
